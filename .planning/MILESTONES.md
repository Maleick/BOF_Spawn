# Milestones

## v1.0 milestone (Shipped: 2026-02-26)

**Phases completed:** 5 phases, 12 plans, 36 tasks
**Archives:** [ROADMAP](./milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md), [REQUIREMENTS](./milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md)

**Key accomplishments:**
- Enforced strict-safe execution defaults with explicit callback and CFG guardrails plus deterministic CNA-to-BOF argument mapping.
- Hardened runtime reliability with centralized cleanup, exact PPID executable matching, and early execution precondition validation.
- Added repeatable local and container build verification plus structured parser-aware pack-contract regression checks.
- Published operator-facing execution validation matrix and NTSTATUS troubleshooting guidance with concise action-first remediation.
- Realigned README and `.planning/codebase/` documents to current post-hardening behavior and requirement traceability.

**Known gaps:**
- No unresolved requirement gaps were accepted at milestone completion.
