# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Operators can reliably launch and execute payloads in x64 target processes from Beacon with explicit, understandable trade-offs between stealth, compatibility, and safety.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Core Reliability Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Core Reliability Hardening)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase 2 execution complete, pending phase verification
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — Completed plan 02-03 and verified RELI-03 progress

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

- Initialization: Treat BOF Spawn as brownfield continuation
- Scope: Prioritize reliability/safety hardening before new feature expansion

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Manual-validation-heavy coverage remains until automated harness is expanded
