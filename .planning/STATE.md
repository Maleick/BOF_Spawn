# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Operators can reliably launch and execute payloads in x64 target processes from Beacon with explicit, understandable trade-offs between stealth, compatibility, and safety.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Core Reliability Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Core Reliability Hardening)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase 1 complete, ready to plan Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — Executed Phase 1 plans and verified SAFE-01..03

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%
